> Comments: Site Looks Great, and I love the theming and character of the entire thing; All of the activities function as intended; In 'Add Two Numbers' you might want to add some validation to make sure that the user inputs numbers (similar to your 'Odd or Even'); Just missing responsiveness, but besides that, everything else is good.
